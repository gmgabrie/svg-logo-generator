  ## Description
  This application is a tool that allows the user to easily create a simple logo using text characters, shapes, and different colors.  With just a few inputs, a quality SVG logo file is generated by the application and saved in the local application directory.  

  ## Installation
  You will need to have VS Code, GitBash, and Node.js installed on your computer to use this application.  From the Github repository for this application, you can click on the Code button and copy the repository link.  Then using Gitbash, clone the repository to your local computer.  Then in VS Code, within the new repository you need to install Node Package Manager (npm init -y), then install Inquirer (npm i inquirer).  In order to run the Jest test script you will also need to install Jest.

  ## Usage
  After all the above software is installed, from Integrated Terminal in VS Code run the command 'node index.js' to start the application.  From there input answers to the various question prompts.  Once completed your newly generated SVG logo file will be created in the same folder as the application itself.

  To run the Jest test script, run 'npm test' from integrated terminal within the application directory.
